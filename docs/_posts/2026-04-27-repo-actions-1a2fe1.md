# Repo Actions — aaronjmars/aeon — 2026-04-27

**Top pick for tomorrow:** #1 — Add `.github/workflows/typescript-check.yml` running `tsc --noEmit` against `dashboard/`, `mcp-server/`, `a2a-server/` (DX, Small)
**Verdict:** Three HIGH-priority structural gaps anchor this cycle, all in `.github/`. Top pick is the TypeScript CI workflow — three real subprojects (dashboard Next.js, mcp-server, a2a-server) ship to `main` today with zero compile-time checks, and the maintainer is actively pushing JS/TS code (PRs #137, #142, #144 all touched these trees in the last 5 days). Yesterday's top picks (dependabot.yml, ISSUE_TEMPLATE, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY) all remain unshipped — carrying dependabot forward.

## Actions

### 1. Add `.github/workflows/typescript-check.yml` running `tsc --noEmit` per JS subproject
**Priority:** HIGH (leverage 4)
**Type:** DX
**Effort:** Small (hours)
**Anchor:** MISSING:.github/workflows/typescript-check.yml + FILE:dashboard/package.json + FILE:mcp-server/package.json + FILE:a2a-server/package.json
**Score:** L=4 C=5 N=5 (total 14/15)
**Impact:** Three TypeScript subprojects (`dashboard/` Next.js 16, `mcp-server/` MCP SDK, `a2a-server/` A2A gateway) live on `main` with no compile-time CI. PR #10 smoke tests validate `SKILL.md` files only. PR #137 (integration examples for A2A + MCP) and PR #142 (skill-analytics widget) shipped TS code in the last 5 days with zero `tsc --noEmit` gate. A type error in any of these slips silently into `main` until a fork's `npm run build` breaks. One workflow catches the entire class.
**How:**
1. Create `.github/workflows/typescript-check.yml` triggered on `pull_request` paths-filter `['dashboard/**', 'mcp-server/**', 'a2a-server/**', '.github/workflows/typescript-check.yml']` and `push` to `main`.
2. Use a matrix strategy: `subproject: [dashboard, mcp-server, a2a-server]`, `node-version: 20` (matches mcp-server/a2a-server `engines.node: >=18` and dashboard's Next 16 minimum).
3. Steps per matrix cell: `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4` with `cache: 'npm'` and `cache-dependency-path: ${{ matrix.subproject }}/package-lock.json`, `npm ci --prefix ${{ matrix.subproject }}`, then `npx --prefix ${{ matrix.subproject }} tsc --noEmit -p ${{ matrix.subproject }}/tsconfig.json`.
4. Add a `concurrency: { group: tsc-${{ github.ref }}, cancel-in-progress: true }` block so superseded PR pushes don't pile up Actions minutes.
5. Open PR with title `ci(typescript): add per-subproject tsc --noEmit on PRs touching dashboard/mcp-server/a2a-server`.
**Definition of done:** PR merged; the next PR touching any of the three trees shows a "TypeScript Check / dashboard | mcp-server | a2a-server" status check; introducing a deliberate type error in a draft PR fails the matching matrix cell.

### 2. Add `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` reflecting the smoke-test contract from PR #10
**Priority:** HIGH (leverage 4)
**Type:** DX
**Effort:** Small (hours)
**Anchor:** MISSING:.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
**Score:** L=4 C=5 N=5 (total 14/15)
**Impact:** Repo merged 20+ PRs in 30 days and has 36 forks; nine of those PRs were operator-driven `improve(...)` autoresearch rewrites of skills (PR #72–#127). There is no PR template, so nothing reminds contributors which boxes the smoke-test (PR #10) and skill-evals (PR #27) frameworks expect: skill name, frontmatter validity, var schema, sandbox-note presence. Contributors who fork to add a skill have to read `CLAUDE.md` *and* PR #10 to discover the contract; a template surfaces it on the new-PR page.
**How:**
1. Create `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with five sections: (a) **Summary** — one paragraph; (b) **Type** — checkboxes for `feat:`, `fix(scope):`, `improve(scope):`, `chore(scope):`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `refactor:` matching the visible commit-message conventions; (c) **Skill changes** — if a `skills/*/SKILL.md` is added or modified, name + category + var schema + sandbox-note confirmation; (d) **Smoke-test status** — a checkbox confirming the contributor ran `./scripts/skill-runs --hours 1` locally or attached a sample run output; (e) **Breaking changes** — explicit Y/N with downstream-fork impact note (relevant for the `fork-skill-digest` consumers).
2. Cross-reference `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/skill-graph.md` from inside the template so first-time contributors land on the existing docs.
3. Open PR with title `docs: add PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md anchored to smoke-test + skill-evals contract`.
**Definition of done:** Opening a new PR on `aaronjmars/aeon` pre-fills the body with the five-section template; the next non-owner contributor PR completes the Skill-changes section.

### 3. Add `.github/release.yml` for autogenerated release-notes category routing
**Priority:** HIGH (leverage 4)
**Type:** DX
**Effort:** Small (hours)
**Anchor:** MISSING:.github/release.yml + TAXONOMY:NO_RELEASES (0 tags, 0 releases against 144 merged PRs)
**Score:** L=4 C=5 N=5 (total 14/15)
**Impact:** Repo has 144 merged PRs and **zero** GitHub Releases or git tags. Without a `.github/release.yml`, `gh release create --generate-notes` produces an undifferentiated bullet list. With one, GitHub auto-buckets PR titles into Added/Changed/Fixed/Security based on labels and title prefixes — which the project already enforces consistently (`feat:`, `fix(scope):`, `improve(scope):`, `chore(security):`). Pairs with yesterday's CHANGELOG proposal (still unshipped) and unlocks the maintainer's option to cut a v0.1.0 baseline whenever they choose, with grant-committee-readable notes coming for free. Independent of CHANGELOG.md — works whether or not that lands.
**How:**
1. Create `.github/release.yml` with a `changelog.categories` block: `Added` (titles matching `feat:` or label `enhancement`), `Changed` (`improve(*):` titles or label `refactor`), `Fixed` (`fix(*):` titles or label `bug`), `Security` (`fix(security):` or label `security`), `Docs` (`docs:` or label `documentation`), `CI/Infra` (`ci:`, `chore(ci):`, `chore(workflow):`), and `Other` as the default bucket.
2. Use `exclude.labels: ['skip-changelog', 'duplicate']` and `exclude.authors: ['dependabot[bot]', 'github-actions[bot]']` (forward-compatible with proposal #1 from yesterday).
3. Open PR with title `ci(release): add .github/release.yml so generated notes group by feat/fix/improve/security`.
**Definition of done:** PR merged; test on a draft tag — `gh release create v0.0.0-test --generate-notes --draft --target main` — shows the merged PRs from the last 30 days bucketed into the configured categories instead of a flat list. Delete the draft afterward.

### 4. Add `.github/FUNDING.yml` routing the existing Bankr badge and any GitHub Sponsors profile
**Priority:** MED (leverage 3)
**Type:** Growth
**Effort:** Small (hours)
**Anchor:** MISSING:.github/FUNDING.yml + FILE:README.md (existing Bankr badge at line ~12)
**Score:** L=3 C=5 N=5 (total 13/15)
**Impact:** README already advertises a `Bankr` badge linking to `bankr.bot/discover/0xbf8e8f0e8866a7052f948c16508644347c57aba3` and PR #144 just shipped `contributor-reward` (a tier-priced rewards plan). The project clearly takes funding seriously, but there is no `Sponsor` button on the repo header — that requires `.github/FUNDING.yml`. A FUNDING.yml is the canonical way to route GitHub's built-in Sponsor button to the existing destinations the project already has (custom URL = the Bankr discover link, plus any GitHub Sponsors handle the maintainer wants enabled). Low effort, immediately visible, no architectural debate.
**How:**
1. Create `.github/FUNDING.yml` with `custom: ['https://bankr.bot/discover/0xbf8e8f0e8866a7052f948c16508644347c57aba3']` (matches the existing README badge target).
2. If the maintainer wants a GitHub Sponsors profile listed (separate from Bankr), add `github: [aaronjmars]` once the Sponsors profile exists. Default the PR to custom-only and put the `github:` line as a commented-out placeholder so the maintainer can uncomment after onboarding.
3. Open PR with title `chore: add FUNDING.yml routing Sponsor button to existing Bankr URL`.
**Definition of done:** PR merged; the repo header on `github.com/aaronjmars/aeon` shows a "❤ Sponsor" button that drops down to the Bankr URL when clicked.

### 5. Add `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` with the default JS/TS analysis config
**Priority:** MED (leverage 3)
**Type:** Security
**Effort:** Small (hours)
**Anchor:** MISSING:.github/workflows/codeql.yml
**Score:** L=3 C=5 N=5 (total 13/15)
**Impact:** Project ships four explicit security skills (`skill-security-scan`, `vuln-scanner`, `workflow-security-audit`, `security-digest`) and yesterday's `security-digest` flagged CVE-2026-40068 against `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`. None of those skills perform static analysis on the project's *own* JS/TS code in `dashboard/`, `mcp-server/`, `a2a-server/`. CodeQL closes that gap with one drop-in workflow and zero new infrastructure — findings land in the Security tab where the proposed (yesterday) `SECURITY.md` would point reporters. Pairs naturally with #1 (TS check) since both run on PRs touching the same trees.
**How:**
1. Create `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` from GitHub's default JS/TS template (`uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3` with `languages: javascript-typescript` and `queries: security-extended,security-and-quality`).
2. Trigger on `pull_request` for `main`, `push` to `main`, and a weekly `schedule: cron: '23 4 * * 1'` (Monday 04:23 UTC — outside the maintainer's existing morning-brief window).
3. Add a `paths` filter scoping to `['dashboard/**', 'mcp-server/**', 'a2a-server/**']` so SKILL.md edits don't trigger redundant scans.
4. Open PR with title `ci(security): add CodeQL JS/TS scanning for dashboard, mcp-server, a2a-server`.
**Definition of done:** PR merged; the repo's Security → Code scanning tab shows a CodeQL run completed within 24h; scheduled weekly run appears in Actions calendar.

## Monitor

### A. Cut `v0.1.0` release with `gh release create --generate-notes`
**Why not yet:** Picking the version baseline (0.1.0 vs 0.0.1 vs 1.0.0 vs date-based) is an owner decision — semver promises constrain future breaking changes. external-feature can prep the tag and the auto-notes once the maintainer signals which version. After #3 (release.yml) lands, the notes will already be bucketed cleanly.
**Anchor:** TAXONOMY:NO_RELEASES + dependent on #3

### B. Expand repo `topics` from 3 → 8 (`agent-framework`, `automation`, `mcp`, `a2a`, `github-actions`, etc.)
**Why not yet:** Currently `aeon`, `ai-agents`, `claude-code`. Adding more topics is a `gh api PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/topics` call — autonomous mechanically — but topic taxonomy is a marketing decision (does the project want to be findable under `agentic-ai` vs `ai-agents` vs both? `github-actions` vs `automation`?). Surface for owner sign-off; not a file-change PR.
**Anchor:** TAXONOMY:DISCOVERY_GAP

### C. Add `.github/CODEOWNERS` with per-tree owners
**Why not yet:** Implementable as a drop-in (`* @aaronjmars` plus `skills/* @aaronjmars`, `dashboard/* @aaronjmars`, etc.), but immediate leverage is low while the maintainer is the sole reviewer. Promote when contributor PR throughput from non-owners ticks up — at current 36 forks with most PRs still owner-authored, CODEOWNERS adds friction without payoff. Tracking.
**Anchor:** MISSING:.github/CODEOWNERS
