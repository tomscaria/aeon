## BLUF

UMA's optimistic-oracle resolution layer — the contract that turns Polymarket trades into payouts — has a documented two-mode failure profile that quant calibration scanners do not see: concentrated whale voting (one address held 25% of UMA votes in the March 2025 $7M Ukraine-mineral resolution) and interpretive ambiguity (the live April 2026 $77M US-Iran ceasefire market trades at 0.1–0.3¢ YES despite multiple credible third-party confirmations). The August 2025 managed-proposer whitelist cut the dispute rate to ~1.3% but does not change either failure mode, so resolution risk is structurally underpriced in any calibration model that only watches the order book.

## Thesis

UMA's managed-proposer fix targets proposal quality, not interpretation, so at least one more interpretively-contested $10M+ Polymarket dispute will reach a DVM vote in the next six months. Whitelisting screens out low-quality proposers — UMA itself reports 99.7% cumulative accuracy across 37 whitelisted addresses against 85.8% for non-whitelisted ([blog.uma.xyz, 2025-08-12](https://blog.uma.xyz/articles/managed-proposers)) — but a 99.7%-accurate proposer is still bound by the literal text of the market clause when the underlying real-world fact is interpretively ambiguous. The Iran-ceasefire market is the active test case ([blockonomi, 2026-04-28](https://blockonomi.com/77m-on-the-edge-of-interpretation-how-one-polymarket-market-turned-a-ceasefire-into-a-legal-dispute)).

## Context

Polymarket settles every market through UMA's optimistic oracle: a proposer stakes a bond and submits an outcome; if no one disputes within a 2-hour challenge window the result is final, otherwise the dispute escalates first to a fresh oracle request and finally to UMA's Data Verification Mechanism (DVM), where token-weighted voting decides the outcome over 48–72 hours ([Polymarket docs](https://docs.polymarket.com/concepts/resolution); [rocknblock.io](https://rocknblock.io/blog/how-prediction-markets-resolution-works-uma-optimistic-oracle-polymarket)). The model's economics-of-truth premise is that disputes will be rare and that the winning side gets the loser's bond.

The premise has cracked twice in publicly documented ways. First, the March 2025 Ukraine mineral-deal market resolved YES on a deal that had not been signed; on-chain analysis tied the result to a single voter holding ~5M UMA tokens across three addresses, equal to 25% of the cast vote, and Polymarket itself called the situation "unprecedented" ([orochi.network, 2025-11-04](https://orochi.network/blog/oracle-manipulation-in-polymarket-2025); [decrypt, 2025-03-26](https://decrypt.co/311634/polymarket-allegations-oracle-manipulation)). Second, the April 2026 US-Iran ceasefire market is now contested *not* because of vote concentration but because the clause "ceasefire extended by April 22" requires direct Iranian government attribution that exists in mediator (Pakistan) and counterparty (US) statements but not in a primary Iranian communiqué.

These are different failure modes. The first is a manipulation problem — a UMA-economic problem. The second is an interpretation problem — a market-design problem. The managed-proposer whitelist addresses neither directly.

## Evidence

- UMA's own August 2025 announcement reports a ~1.3% dispute rate, ~500% year-over-year oracle usage growth, and 99.7% cumulative accuracy across 37 whitelisted Polymarket-proposer addresses vs. 85.8% for non-whitelisted ([blog.uma.xyz](https://blog.uma.xyz/articles/managed-proposers)).
- The Wen-Zhou-Huang LLM-arbitration study found 89.58% agreement between web-enabled LLMs and final UMA resolutions on disputed markets aggregating $972M+ in trading volume — high agreement on already-disputed cases, but LLMs could not predict *which* markets would become disputed in advance ([arXiv:2604.15674](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.15674)).
- Two UMA addresses control more than half of UMA voting power per Folke Hermansen's on-chain analysis cited in the Ukraine post-mortem ([decrypt, 2025-03-26](https://decrypt.co/311634/polymarket-allegations-oracle-manipulation)).
- The active US-Iran ceasefire Polymarket market trades YES at 0.1–0.3¢ despite Trump's announced extension and Pakistani mediator confirmation, because traders are pricing the literal-text interpretation risk that no Iranian government communiqué exists ([blockonomi, 2026-04-28](https://blockonomi.com/77m-on-the-edge-of-interpretation-how-one-polymarket-market-turned-a-ceasefire-into-a-legal-dispute)).
- The CFTC has cited prediction-market manipulation risk in its Kalshi case, an external regulatory signal that whitelist-style solutions are unlikely to satisfy ([cryptopolitan](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polymarket-community-protests-oracle-vote-by-uma-whales-claims-market-manipulation/)).

## Key papers

- **Wen, Zhou, Huang — *Can LLMs Help Decentralized Dispute Arbitration? A Case Study of UMA-Resolved Markets on Polymarket*** (arXiv:2604.15674, 2026-04-17). Web-enabled LLMs reach 89.58% agreement with UMA's final resolutions on disputed markets, but cannot reliably anticipate disputes in advance — directly relevant to building a calibration scanner that flags resolution risk early. [arxiv.org/abs/2604.15674](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.15674)
- **Rohanifar, Ahmed, Sultana — *Prediction Laundering: The Illusion of Neutrality, Transparency, and Governance in Polymarket*** (arXiv:2602.05181, 2026-02-05). N=27 sociotechnical audit of Polymarket's UMA pipeline; defines a four-stage "laundering" by which subjective high-uncertainty bets are stripped of their original noise and presented as objective probability, with truth-resolution offloaded to off-platform Discord. The interpretation-gap framing maps cleanly onto Iran-cf vs Hez-cf style divergences. [arxiv.org/abs/2602.05181](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05181)

Eight-stage workflow places "market resolution" as a discrete stage with explicit decentralization vs manipulation-resistance trade-offs, the conceptual scaffold under which to score UMA-Polymarket against alternatives.

## What would change my mind

- Zero new $10M+ Polymarket markets reach a DVM vote in the next six months (May–Oct 2026) — would falsify the thesis directly.
- UMA ships an interpretive-clause arbitration tier separate from the proposer whitelist (e.g., a domain-expert panel for ambiguous-text markets) before any further $10M dispute lands.
- A reproducible study shows UMA voter concentration has dropped below 10% for the largest single voter across all >$1M-stake DVM votes in 2026 — would falsify the manipulation-mode half of the thesis.
- The Iran-ceasefire market resolves YES on the strength of mediator/US statements alone, with the DVM rejecting the strict-text interpretation — would suggest the interpretation gap is self-correcting.

## Open questions

- What is the empirical concentration of UMA voting power in late 2026 vs early 2025? The 25%-share datapoint is over a year old.
- Does the 89.58% LLM-UMA agreement rate hold on interpretive-clause disputes specifically, or only on factually-recoverable disputes? The arxiv abstract does not break it out.
- Does Polymarket's $1M LP fund (announced as part of the V2 cutover, see `memory/topics/polymarket.md`) cover resolution-controversy refunds, or only execution-side losses?
- Does whitelisted proposer accuracy degrade as proposal volume grows ~500% YoY?

## Connections

- **CalibrationGap (Revenant)** — the agent's quant scanner reads order-book and basis signals; resolution-layer failure is invisible to it. Surfacing UMA dispute risk as a separate scan (LLM-on-clause-text classifier per the Wen et al. method) would be a natural Apex-gate-stage capability extension. See `memory/MEMORY.md` Active project.
- **LOOP-violation / cross-venue convergence** (`memory/topics/polymarket.md`) — resolution-layer disputes break the no-arbitrage assumption underlying every basis trade against Polymarket. A persistent ~30% Polymarket-discount-to-Kalshi narrative price (per `topics/grants.md` data) is partly resolution-risk premium, not just liquidity premium.
- **Hermes-arb Kalshi↔Polymarket BTC convergence** — Kalshi resolutions go through CFTC-supervised settlement; Polymarket through UMA. The basis recorder should attribute residual divergence between resolution-risk and pure microstructure.
- **Grant applications** (Anthropic, AWS Activate) — the LLM-as-arbitrator finding (89.58% agreement) is a citable bridge between prediction-market microstructure and LLM-evaluation literature, useful for the PhD-prep narrative.
