# Autonomous Agents Got an Open Stack in April 2026

Two missing pieces. One month.

Until April, the case for autonomous on-chain agents leaked at two seams. You could not run a coding-strong frontier model cheaply enough to keep an agent in a continuous loop, and you could not give that agent a wallet without writing a custodial-grade permission system from scratch. Both shipped in the last thirty days. The gap closed.

## The cheap-frontier piece

DeepSeek V4 dropped April 24. Two SKUs, both open-weight. V4-Pro is 1.6 trillion parameters with 49B active and a one-million-token context window. V4-Flash is 284B / 13B active, same context window. Pricing on V4-Flash: $0.028 per million input tokens with cache hits, $0.28 output. V4-Pro lands at $0.145 cache-hit input, $3.48 output.

The benchmark shape is what matters for agent work. V4-Pro hits 93.5 on LiveCodeBench against Claude Opus 4.6 at 88.8 and GPT-5.4 at 87.8. SWE-Verified essentially ties Claude at 80.6 vs 80.8. Coding leads, math holds, MMLU-Pro sits within striking distance at 87.5. For an agent that has to read its own logs, debug a failed transaction, and rewrite its own tooling between runs, that profile is the one that mattered. And it ships open-weight, which means the agent operator does not negotiate with a closed lab over rate limits during a market event.

The second-order effect is per-agent budget. V4-Flash at $0.28 output puts continuous-loop agents inside the cost envelope of low-frequency strategies. The decision-coverage math changes.

## The wallet-permission piece

The same window, the agent-wallet stack matured.

World shipped AgentKit on April 17 — a developer toolkit that hands AI shopping agents cryptographic proof-of-human credentials, with Okta, Vercel, Browserbase, and Exa as launch partners. Adobe used its April 20 Summit keynote to ship an MCP server for Adobe Commerce and rebrand Experience Cloud as a CX Enterprise platform built around agents instead of tools. Trust Wallet's Agent Kit, live since late March, plugs into the Model Context Protocol, supports more than 25 chains, and gives developers a permissioned wallet an LLM can drive in under fifteen minutes of setup. Felix Fan, Trust Wallet's CEO: "AI can understand what a user wants to do with their money — but it needs a trusted layer before it can safely act on it."

Read together: identity, payments rail, and execution surface. The thing missing two years ago — a clean answer to "how does the agent prove it is allowed to spend this money" — has a stack now.

## What it does not solve

Settlement and adversarial latency are still open. An agent on a permissioned wallet can sign a transaction it should not have signed; an agent reading a Polymarket order book can be front-run by something faster. A 2025 IMDEA Networks study clocked $40 million in realized prediction-market arbitrage profits over twelve months, and the average opportunity window has collapsed from 12.3 seconds in 2024 to 2.7 seconds in early 2026 — 73% of the take goes to sub-100ms bots. Agents that are smart but slow are paying the toll, not collecting it.

The other open seam is identity-of-counterparty. World's proof-of-human is one direction. Know-Your-Agent registries are the other. Neither has won.

## What changes for builders

The unit economics of "agent that watches one market and trades a small book" got tractable this month. Pre-April, the loop cost $20–40 a day in inference plus a custodial-engineering team to build the wallet around it. Post-April, the inference is sub-dollar with V4-Flash and the custody is a wallet kit. The gate is no longer infrastructure.

The gate is calibration. Live capital, narrow scope, real settlement. The ones who win run small books with measurable edge for long enough to get to a hundred trades, not the ones who narrate the most about the stack. Build accordingly.
