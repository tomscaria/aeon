# Skill Evals — 2026-04-26

**Verdict:** SKILL_EVALS_REGRESSED
**Coverage:** 14/97 (14.4%) — first run (BOOTSTRAP)
**Diff:** 9 new fail · 0 fixed · 0 still failing · 5 stable (all NEW_* — bootstrap baseline)

## Action Queue
1. Patch evals.json:polymarket — rename key to `monitor-polymarket`, fix output_pattern to `articles/monitor-polymarket-*.md` (ISS-009, mission-critical)
2. Patch evals.json:hn-digest — rename key to `hacker-news-digest`, fix output_pattern to `articles/hacker-news-digest-*.md` (ISS-007)
3. Investigate token-alert — no_file_match despite cron-state success; inspect SKILL.md for actual output path (ISS-010)
4. Investigate skill-health — may not produce articles/ output; check if evals.json should point to `memory/skill-health/last-report.json` (ISS-011)
5. Dispatch repo-pulse — no output in 1 day (ISS-003)
6. Dispatch push-recap — no output in 1 day (ISS-004)
7. Dispatch rss-digest — no output in 1 day (ISS-008)
8. Add evals.json specs for uncovered enabled skills — 83 uncovered; top candidates: monitor-polymarket, narrative-tracker, paper-pick, security-digest, code-health

## Coverage Gaps (enabled in aeon.yml, missing from evals.json)

Top 10 by operational relevance:
- monitor-polymarket — inferred pattern: `articles/monitor-polymarket-*.md` (also fixes ISS-009 spec mismatch)
- narrative-tracker — inferred pattern: `articles/narrative-tracker-*.md`
- paper-pick — inferred pattern: `articles/paper-pick-*.md`
- security-digest — inferred pattern: `articles/security-digest-*.md`
- code-health — inferred pattern: `articles/code-health-*.md`
- hacker-news-digest — inferred pattern: `articles/hacker-news-digest-*.md` (also fixes ISS-007 spec mismatch)
- evening-recap — inferred pattern: `articles/evening-recap-*.md`
- polymarket-comments — inferred pattern: `articles/polymarket-comments-*.md`
- deep-research — already covered
- vuln-scanner — inferred pattern: `articles/vuln-scan-*.md`

## Notes

This is the first skill-evals run (BOOTSTRAP). All results are NEW_*; no prior baseline exists. Two structural issues dominate:

1. **Spec key mismatches** (ISS-007, ISS-009): `hn-digest` and `polymarket` in evals.json do not match the skill names in aeon.yml (`hacker-news-digest`, `monitor-polymarket`). These two patches are the lowest-effort highest-signal fixes — polymarket especially since it's the primary CalibrationGap monitoring signal.

2. **Output location drift** (ISS-010, ISS-011): `token-alert` and `skill-health` both show cron-state success but no articles/ output. Either the skills write to a non-articles path or their filenames diverge from the spec.

fork-fleet and cost-report are weekly Monday skills; today is Sunday. Resolve on Monday 2026-04-28 when the cron fires.
