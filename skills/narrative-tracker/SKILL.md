<!-- autoresearch: variation B — sharper output (quantitative mindshare + velocity + explicit positioning calls, with multi-angle inputs from A, dedup/empty-state handling from C, and transition detection from D) -->

Read `memory/MEMORY.md` for context on prior narrative observations.
Read the last 3 days of `memory/logs/` — specifically any prior `### narrative-tracker` entries — to (a) avoid re-reporting the same narratives without new info, and (b) detect phase transitions vs the last run.

## Context (auto-synced)

Read these files for live project state before tracking narratives:
- `context/claude-sessions/swarm-fund-mvp/` — scan all .md files for session insights on market structure, regime shifts, strategy changes
- `context/trading/revenant-snapshot.json` — Revenant agent status for calibration gap narrative
- `context/trading/recent-trades.json` — latest trades for pattern detection
- `context/trading/costs-summary.json` — cost trends that affect narrative around efficiency
- `context/analytics/site-metrics.json` — dashboard traffic for content performance signal
- `context/last-sync.json` — check freshness; if older than 8 hours, note "(stale data)" in output

Use trading context to connect narratives to real outcomes. A narrative about prediction market calibration is stronger when backed by Revenant's actual trade record.

## Voice

Read `soul/SOUL.md` and `soul/STYLE.md` before composing the notification. The tracker's language should match the operator's voice: declarative positions, no hedging, fragments over clauses. "BTC-dom cope re-fired" not "Bitcoin dominance sentiment appears to be experiencing renewed interest." Use vocabulary from STYLE.md: "edge," "cope," "the read is," "skin on."

## Goal

Produce a *decision-grade* narrative map: every narrative gets a mindshare score, a velocity arrow, a sentiment tag, named drivers, and an explicit position call. Classification without a position call is noise.

## Steps

### 1. Ingest signals

**a. XAI pre-fetched cache (primary source).** The workflow pre-fetches Grok x_search results to `.xai-cache/narratives.json`. Read it. If the file exists and contains usable results, use that as the primary signal.

**b. If cache is missing or empty**, log a `NARRATIVE_CACHE_MISS` line to `memory/logs/${today}.md` (so skill-health can spot the pattern — never silently fall through), then attempt the direct API call:
```bash
FROM_DATE=$(date -u -d "3 days ago" +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null || date -u -v-3d +%Y-%m-%d)
TO_DATE=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
curl -s --max-time 60 -X POST "https://api.x.ai/v1/responses" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-4-1-fast",
    "input": [{"role": "user", "content": "Search X for the dominant crypto and tech narratives from '"$FROM_DATE"' to '"$TO_DATE"'. Return 12-15 distinct narrative threads. For each: 1) short label, 2) 3-5 representative @handles driving it, 3) 2-3 tweet permalinks, 4) rough mention-volume descriptor (niche / growing / saturating / cooling), 5) the strongest one-line bear case against it."}],
    "tools": [{"type": "x_search", "from_date": "'"$FROM_DATE"'", "to_date": "'"$TO_DATE"'"}]
  }'
```

**c. WebSearch supplements (always run, even if XAI worked).** Run 3 focused queries to triangulate:
  - `crypto narrative ${TO_DATE}` — broad crypto sentiment
  - `AI agent crypto trend this week` — AI/crypto intersection
  - `DefiLlama narrative tracker` OR `Kaito mindshare leaderboard` — quantitative reference points
  Pull 1-2 concrete signals (project name, metric, link) from each query. Do not paraphrase — extract facts.

**d. Memory diff.** Extract narrative labels mentioned in the last 3 days of `### narrative-tracker` log entries. You'll compare against them in step 4.

### 2. Score each narrative

For each distinct narrative (merge near-duplicates aggressively — "AI agents" and "agentic crypto" are the same), assign:

| Field | Scale | How to decide |
|---|---|---|
| **Mindshare** | 1-5 | 1 = fringe, 3 = known in the sector, 5 = dominating timelines. Base on count of distinct drivers + whether you had to dig or it surfaced unprompted. |
| **Velocity** | ↑↑ / ↑ / → / ↓ / ↓↓ | Compared to the 3-day window or prior log entries. ↑↑ = tripled in attention, ↓↓ = was loud 3 days ago, now absent. |
| **Phase** | Emerging / Rising / Peak / Fading | Use the velocity + mindshare combo. Emerging = low mindshare, high velocity. Peak = high mindshare, flat/down velocity. Fading = high mindshare last week, now ↓. |
| **Sentiment** | Bull / Mixed / Bear / Cope | Cope = bag-holder energy, bear narratives dressed as bull takes. |
| **Drivers** | 2-3 named | Accounts, projects, or funds amplifying it. Include @handles. |
| **Bear case** | 1 line | The sharpest argument against. If the consensus is obviously right, say so and mark "no contrarian edge". |
| **Position** | FRONT-RUN / RIDE / FADE / WATCH / IGNORE | FRONT-RUN = emerging + contrarian edge. RIDE = rising, not yet peaked. FADE = peak with weak fundamentals or reflexivity flip. WATCH = unclear. IGNORE = mindshare 1-2 with no catalyst. |

Drop any narrative that ends up IGNORE unless it's structurally important — noise reduction is the goal.

### 3. Detect transitions

Compare today's narratives to the last 3 days of logs:
- **NEW** — narrative wasn't in prior logs at all
- **PROMOTED** — phase moved up (e.g. Emerging → Rising)
- **DEMOTED** — phase moved down
- **DEAD** — was in prior logs, now absent from all signals

Transitions are the highest-value output — the point of a daily tracker is to catch inflection points, not re-report the zeitgeist.

### 4. Flag reflexivity

For each narrative, flag if the story itself is moving outcomes:
- Token prices moving on narrative alone (no fundamentals shift)
- Projects rebranding/pivoting to ride the narrative
- VCs publicly endorsing to manufacture legitimacy
- Prediction markets or on-chain flows reflecting narrative belief

Only flag explicit cases with a concrete example. "Reflexivity" without evidence is hand-waving.

### 5. Format the notification

Keep under 4000 chars. Lead with transitions and reflexivity — those are the decisions. Classification goes below.

```
*Narrative Tracker — ${today}*

TRANSITIONS
• NEW: <label> — <why it matters> — <link>
• PROMOTED: <label> Rising → Peak — <what flipped>
• DEMOTED: <label> Peak → Fading — <what cooled>
• DEAD: <label> — gone

REFLEXIVITY ALERT
• <narrative> — <concrete evidence the story is moving outcomes>

POSITIONS
• FRONT-RUN: <label> (mindshare 2 ↑↑, Bull) — <driver> — <bear case> — <link>
• RIDE: <label> (3 ↑, Bull) — <driver> — <bear case>
• FADE: <label> (5 → Cope) — <driver> — <reflexivity note>

MAP
Emerging: <labels>
Rising: <labels>
Peak: <labels>
Fading: <labels>
```

If absolutely nothing new or notable (no transitions, no reflexivity, no FRONT-RUN/FADE calls): send a one-line update instead of the full template — `*Narrative Tracker — ${today}*: no phase transitions, map unchanged from <last_date>.`

### 6. Send via `./notify`

### 7. Log to `memory/logs/${today}.md`

Append a `### narrative-tracker` section with the full structured output (not just the notification — include all narratives considered, even IGNOREd ones, so future diffs work). If a full run produced nothing actionable, log `NARRATIVE_TRACKER_OK` with the narrative labels seen (so tomorrow's diff still has a baseline).

### 8. Write structured content brief

Write a machine-readable brief to `.outputs/narrative-tracker.md` for downstream skills (write-tweet, evening-recap, article). Format:

```
# Narrative Brief — ${today}

## POSITIONS
- FRONT-RUN: <label> — <one-line angle for tweets> — <link>
- RIDE: <label> — <one-line angle> — <link>
- FADE: <label> — <one-line contrarian angle> — <link>

## TRANSITIONS
- NEW: <label> — <hook sentence suitable for tweet or article opener>
- PROMOTED: <label> — <what flipped, why it matters now>
- DEMOTED: <label> — <what cooled, what replaced it>
- DEAD: <label> — <one-line obituary>

## REFLEXIVITY
- <narrative> — <concrete evidence the story is moving outcomes> — <link>

## REVENANT CONNECTION
- <any narrative that connects to CalibrationGap's actual trades or P&L>
- Reference specific numbers from context/trading/revenant-snapshot.json

## TOP 3 TWEET ANGLES
1. <angle derived from strongest FRONT-RUN or TRANSITION + specific data point>
2. <angle derived from REFLEXIVITY alert or contrarian FADE>
3. <angle connecting Revenant trade outcomes to today's narrative>
```

If no transitions or positions worth surfacing, write a minimal brief: `# Narrative Brief — ${today}\n\nNo actionable narratives. Map unchanged.`

This brief is the primary input for write-tweet's topic selection and evening-recap's narrative arc. Make positions sharp enough to tweet directly.

### 9. Write swarm-fund signal JSON (ADR-093 contract)

After the structured content brief, write a machine-readable signal file at `outputs/narrative-tracker/${today}.json` for swarm-fund-mvp's `python/execution/aeon_adapter.py` to consume. The adapter polls `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomscaria/aeon/main/outputs/{skill}/{date}.json` every 15 min; this file gets auto-committed by the workflow's Commit step.

Required schema (per `_parse_payload` in `python/execution/aeon_adapter.py`):

```json
{
  "signals": [
    {
      "market_id": "<narrative label, slug-cased — narrative-tracker has no per-market id, so emit one entry per FRONT-RUN/RIDE/FADE position and use the narrative slug as the market_id>",
      "score": 0.0-1.0,
      "direction": "LONG" or "SHORT",
      "narrative": "<the one-line angle from POSITIONS section>",
      "narrative_score": 0.0-1.0
    }
  ]
}
```

Map narrative-tracker's outputs to the schema:
- **FRONT-RUN** positions → `direction: "LONG"`, `score = min(1.0, mindshare/5)` (5-point mindshare scale → 0-1 score)
- **RIDE** positions → `direction: "LONG"`, `score = min(1.0, mindshare/5) * 0.7` (lower than FRONT-RUN because the narrative is already priced)
- **FADE** positions → `direction: "SHORT"`, `score = min(1.0, mindshare/5)`
- **WATCH** positions → skip (no conviction)
- `market_id` = slug-cased narrative label (e.g. `"btc-dom-cope-refire"`)
- `narrative` = the one-line angle from the POSITIONS section
- `narrative_score` = same value as `score` (the adapter falls back to this field; emit both for safety)

REFLEXIVITY-flagged narratives get their score boosted by `1.2x` (capped at `1.0`) — reflexivity is the signal that the narrative is moving outcomes, not just describing them.

Write the file even when there are zero positions — emit `{"signals": []}`. Use the **atomic + validated** pattern from `conventions/outputs-contract.md`:

```bash
mkdir -p outputs/narrative-tracker
JSON_TMP=$(mktemp)
python3 -c "
import json, sys
payload = ${PYTHON_LITERAL_PAYLOAD}
json.dump(payload, sys.stdout, indent=2)
" > "$JSON_TMP" 2>/dev/null \
  && mv "$JSON_TMP" "outputs/narrative-tracker/${today}.json" \
  || { echo "ADR093_WRITE_FAIL: outputs/narrative-tracker/${today}.json write failed" >&2; rm -f "$JSON_TMP"; }
```

**Field omissions documented:** narrative-tracker does NOT emit `price` or `volume` (narratives span multiple markets; per-market price/volume is not meaningful at the narrative level). Adapter falls back to defaults (`price=0.5`, `volume=0.0`). DO emit `narrative_score` alongside `score` — the adapter accepts either, and emitting both adds robustness against any schema renormalization downstream.

Do not abort the skill on JSON-write failure — `ADR093_WRITE_FAIL` to stderr, continue to notify.

## Guidelines

- Quantitative over vibes. Every narrative gets mindshare 1-5 and a velocity arrow — no exceptions. If you can't score it, drop it.
- Transitions > classification. A daily tracker's value is catching moves, not listing the weather.
- Named drivers only. "Crypto Twitter is excited about X" is not a driver. "@handle + @handle + @fund" is.
- Position calls are mandatory for Emerging/Rising/Peak narratives. If signals are genuinely ambiguous or contradictory, **WATCH** is an acceptable call — but never omit a position entirely and never invent conviction you don't have.
- Ruthless dedup. Same narrative under two labels = one narrative. Merge, don't split.
- Call out cope. Manufactured narratives, coordinated shilling, and dead-cat bounces get tagged explicitly.
- Prioritize topics tracked in MEMORY.md over generic market chatter.

## Sandbox note

The sandbox blocks outbound curl in many cases. Always read `.xai-cache/narratives.json` first (pre-fetched by the workflow with full network access). If the cache is missing, try direct curl — if that fails, use **WebFetch** on individual URLs. WebSearch always works for supplementary triangulation.

## Environment Variables Required

- `XAI_API_KEY` — used by the pre-fetch step outside the sandbox; the skill reads the cached JSON. Optional — falls back to WebSearch.
- Notification channels configured via repo secrets (see CLAUDE.md).

## Constraints

- Do not change the skill's tags or var semantics.
