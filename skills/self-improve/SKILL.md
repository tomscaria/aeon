> **${var}** — Specific area to improve (e.g. "heartbeat", "notifications", "memory"). If empty, finds the highest-impact issue from recent logs.

If `${var}` is set, focus on improving that specific area.

Read memory/MEMORY.md for context.
Read the last 2 days of memory/logs/ for recent errors, failures, and quality issues.

## Context (auto-synced)

Read these files before identifying improvements:
- `context/claude-sessions/swarm-fund-mvp/` — scan all .md files for session hot-fixes, debugging patterns, and recurring issues
- `context/trading/costs-summary.json` — 7-day cost trends by vendor
- `context/trading/agents-summary.json` — agent population health, lifecycle distribution
- `context/analytics/site-metrics.json` — dashboard/landing page performance
- `context/analytics/social-metrics.json` — tweet and content engagement (if available)
- `context/last-sync.json` — check freshness; if older than 8 hours, note "(stale data)" in output

Prioritize improvements that address patterns visible in session context (repeated failures, manual workarounds) and cost/performance trends.

## Steps

1. **Check for open improvement PRs** — don't pile up unreviewed work:
   ```bash
   OPEN_PRS=$(gh pr list --state open --json title,number --jq '[.[] | select(.title | test("^(fix|feat|chore)\\("; "i"))] | length')
   ```
   If there are already 3+ open improvement PRs, log "self-improve: 3+ open PRs, waiting for review" and exit. Don't create more debt.

2. **Identify what to improve.** If `${var}` is empty, scan for issues:
   - Read `memory/logs/` from last 2 days — look for:
     - Skills that failed or produced low-quality output
     - Errors, timeouts, "zero output", rate limiting
     - Notifications that didn't send or were truncated
     - Memory consolidation problems
   - Read `memory/cron-state.json` for skills with low success rates
   - Read `articles/repo-actions-*.md` from last 7 days for self-improvement ideas
   - Read context pipeline data for systemic patterns:
     - `context/trading/costs-summary.json` — if 7-day cost trend is rising >10%, propose model downgrade or schedule reduction for highest-cost skills
     - `context/analytics/site-metrics.json` — if dashboard traffic dropped >20% week-over-week, investigate content pipeline health
     - `context/analytics/social-metrics.json` — if tweet engagement dropped, check write-tweet and reply-maker quality
     - `context/claude-sessions/swarm-fund-mvp/` — scan for patterns like "manually fixed X" or "worked around Y" that indicate a skill should be automated or a bug should be patched
   - Prioritization order for context-derived fixes:
     1. Cost overruns (directly burns money)
     2. Session workarounds that could be automated (operator time saved)
     3. Content engagement drops (affects external visibility)
     4. Agent population health issues (affects core research)
   - Pick the **highest-impact, smallest-effort** fix. One change per run.

3. **Understand the area you're fixing.** Read the relevant files:
   - Skills: `skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
   - Config: `aeon.yml`
   - Workflows: `.github/workflows/*.yml`
   - Agent instructions: `CLAUDE.md`
   - Dashboard: `dashboard/` (if UI-related)
   
   Understand the current behavior before changing anything.

4. **Implement the fix.** Make minimal, targeted changes:
   - If a skill prompt is unclear → rewrite the ambiguous section
   - If a skill is hitting rate limits → add backoff logic or reduce frequency
   - If output quality is low → tighten the prompt, add examples, clarify format
   - If a notification is broken → fix the formatting or truncation
   - If a config is wrong → fix aeon.yml

   Do NOT:
   - Rewrite entire skills from scratch
   - Add new features (that's build-skill's job)
   - Change the core architecture
   - Modify secrets or environment variables

5. **Create a branch and PR:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/self-improve-${today}
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: [description of what was improved]

   Problem: [what was failing/degraded]
   Fix: [what was changed]
   Evidence: [log entries, error messages, success rates]"
   ```
   Open a PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "fix: [short description]" \
     --body "## Problem
   [What was failing or degraded — cite specific log entries or error messages]

   ## Fix
   [What was changed and why]

   ## Evidence
   - [Relevant log entries]
   - [Success rate before: X%]
   - [Error pattern: ...]"
   ```

6. **Notify.** Send via `./notify`:
   ```
   self-improve: [what was fixed] — PR: [url]
   ```

7. **Log.** Append to `memory/logs/${today}.md`:
   ```
   ## Self Improve
   - **Target:** [what was improved]
   - **Problem:** [what was failing]
   - **Fix:** [what was changed]
   - **PR:** [url]
   ```

## Guidelines

- ONE fix per run. Don't bundle unrelated changes.
- Smallest viable fix. A one-line prompt tweak > a full rewrite.
- If you can't find anything to improve, that's fine. Log "self-improve: everything looks healthy" and exit.
- Never modify workflow files (.github/workflows/) — only skill files, CLAUDE.md, and aeon.yml.
- Don't create circular improvements (e.g. don't improve self-improve).

## Sandbox note

This skill uses local file reads and web search only. No outbound API calls needed.

## Constraints

- Do not change the skill's tags or var semantics.
