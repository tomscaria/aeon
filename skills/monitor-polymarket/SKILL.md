> **${var}** — Event slug to monitor (e.g. "us-x-iran-ceasefire-by"). If empty, reads the watchlist from `skills/monitor-polymarket/watchlist.md`.

Read `memory/MEMORY.md` for context.
Read the last 2 days of `memory/logs/` to compare against previous readings and flag changes.

## Watchlist

The default watchlist lives at `skills/monitor-polymarket/watchlist.md`. Each line is an event slug. Add or remove slugs to change what gets monitored.

If `${var}` is set, monitor only that single event (useful for ad-hoc checks).

## Steps

### 1. Load watchlist

```bash
if [ -n "${var}" ]; then
  SLUGS="${var}"
else
  # Read watchlist file, one slug per line, skip comments and blanks
  SLUGS=$(grep -v '^#' skills/monitor-polymarket/watchlist.md | grep -v '^$')
fi
```

### 2. For each event, fetch markets and price history

For each event slug in the watchlist:

**a) Get the event and its markets:**
```bash
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?slug=$SLUG&limit=1"
```

The response contains the event `id`, `title`, and a `markets` array. Each market has:
- `id`, `question`, `slug`, `closed`
- `outcomePrices` — JSON array, index 0 = YES price (0.0–1.0)
- `volume24hr`, `volumeNum`, `liquidityNum`
- `clobTokenIds` — JSON array, index 0 = YES token, index 1 = NO token

**Skip closed markets** — they've already resolved.

**b) Get 24h price history for each open market:**
```bash
# YES token is index 0 of clobTokenIds
TOKEN_ID=$(echo "$CLOB_TOKEN_IDS" | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.loads(sys.stdin.read())[0])")
curl -s "https://clob.polymarket.com/prices-history?market=$TOKEN_ID&interval=1d&fidelity=60"
```

Response: `{ "history": [{ "t": unix_timestamp, "p": "price_string" }, ...] }`

**c) Calculate 24h stats for each market:**
- **Open / Close** — first and last price in the history
- **Change** — close minus open, in percentage points (e.g. +4.0pp)
- **High / Low** — intraday range
- **Volume** — `volume24hr` from the market data
- **Direction** — classify as: surging (>+5pp), rising (+2 to +5pp), stable (-2 to +2pp), falling (-5 to -2pp), crashing (<-5pp)

### 3. Fetch comments

For each event, get top comments and latest comments:

```bash
EVENT_ID=... # from step 2a

# Top comments by reactions
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/comments?parent_entity_type=Event&parent_entity_id=$EVENT_ID&limit=10&order=reactionCount&ascending=false"

# Latest comments (last 24h chatter)
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/comments?parent_entity_type=Event&parent_entity_id=$EVENT_ID&limit=10&order=createdAt&ascending=false"
```

**Important:** `parent_entity_type` must be `Event` (capital E).

Each comment has: `body`, `profile.username` (often null → use "anon"), `reactionCount`, `createdAt`.

From the combined results, pick the **3 most interesting comments** per event:
- New comments from the last 24h get priority (they react to recent moves)
- High-reaction comments that are still relevant
- Contrarian takes, insider-sounding analysis, whale callouts, humor

### 4. Build the report

For each event, produce a summary block:

```
**[Event Title]** (event_id: N)

| Market | YES | 24h Chg | High/Low | 24h Vol |
|--------|-----|---------|----------|---------|
| [question] | XX.X% | +X.Xpp ▲ | XX–XX% | $X.Xm |
| [question] | XX.X% | -X.Xpp ▼ | XX–XX% | $X.Xm |
...

Biggest mover: "[question]" — [direction] from X% to Y%

Comments:
- [user/anon]: "[comment excerpt]" (X upvotes)
- [user/anon]: "[comment excerpt]"
- [user/anon]: "[comment excerpt]"
```

Flag any market that moved more than **5 percentage points** in 24h — these are the ones worth paying attention to.

### 5. Notify

Send via `./notify` (under 4000 chars):
```
polymarket monitor — ${today}

[Event Title]
[market] YES X% (chg pp) $Xm vol
[market] YES X% (chg pp) $Xm vol
biggest mover: [market] — [direction]
top comment: "[excerpt]"

[next event...]

alerts: [list any markets that moved >5pp]
```

If no markets moved significantly, say so — "all quiet" is useful signal too.

### 6. Write swarm-fund signal JSON (ADR-093 contract)

After notify, write a structured JSON file at `outputs/monitor-polymarket/${today}.json` for swarm-fund-mvp's `python/execution/aeon_adapter.py` to consume. The adapter polls `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomscaria/aeon/main/outputs/{skill}/{date}.json` every 15 min via the GitHub raw content API; this file gets auto-committed by the workflow's Commit step.

Required schema (per `_parse_payload` in `python/execution/aeon_adapter.py`):

```json
{
  "signals": [
    {
      "market_id": "<numeric market id from Gamma API, or slug>",
      "score": 0.0-1.0,
      "direction": "LONG" or "SHORT",
      "narrative": "<one-line summary, typically the market question>",
      "price": 0.0-1.0,
      "volume": <24h volume number>,
      "price_drift": <24h change in pp, signed>
    }
  ]
}
```

For each market with `|24h_change_pp| > 1.0` (broader net than the 5pp alert threshold so the swarm gets sub-alert signal too), emit one entry. Mapping:
- `market_id` = market `id` from the Gamma API (fall back to `slug` if absent)
- `score` = `min(1.0, abs(price_drift_pp) / 10.0)` — a 10pp move maxes out the score
- `direction` = `"LONG"` if `price_drift > 0` else `"SHORT"`
- `narrative` = market `question`
- `price` = YES `outcomePrices[0]` (parsed from JSON string)
- `volume` = `volume24hr`
- `price_drift` = signed 24h change in pp (e.g. `+4.0`)

Write the file even when `signals` is empty — an empty array tells the adapter the skill ran. Use the **atomic + validated** pattern from `conventions/outputs-contract.md`: serialize via Python's `json.dump` to a temp file, then `mv` into place. Python validates structure before write; atomic rename prevents partial files.

```bash
mkdir -p outputs/monitor-polymarket
JSON_TMP=$(mktemp)
python3 -c "
import json, sys
payload = ${PYTHON_LITERAL_PAYLOAD}
json.dump(payload, sys.stdout, indent=2)
" > "$JSON_TMP" 2>/dev/null \
  && mv "$JSON_TMP" "outputs/monitor-polymarket/${today}.json" \
  || { echo "ADR093_WRITE_FAIL: outputs/monitor-polymarket/${today}.json write failed (validation or disk)" >&2; rm -f "$JSON_TMP"; }
```

Where `${PYTHON_LITERAL_PAYLOAD}` is a Python dict/list literal built from the per-market data above (e.g. `{"signals": [{"market_id": "12345", "score": 0.5, ...}, ...]}`). Do not embed a JSON-string-as-bash-variable — pass the literal directly so Python's parser validates it.

If both the write and the explicit error path fail, the `ADR093_WRITE_FAIL` line lands in stderr (captured by the workflow log) and the skill continues to the notify step. The signal-publication path must NEVER block the human-notify path. Next workflow run will retry (idempotent).

### 7. Log

Append to `memory/logs/${today}.md`:
```
## Monitor Polymarket
- **Events monitored:** N
- **Markets tracked:** N (M open, K closed)
- **Biggest mover:** "[question]" — X% → Y% (+/-Zpp)
- **Alert markets (>5pp move):** [list or "none"]
- **Top comment:** "[excerpt]"
- **Notification sent:** yes
```

If a market has moved dramatically or a new trend is forming, also note it in `memory/MEMORY.md` for future reference.

## Sandbox note

The sandbox may block outbound curl. Use **WebFetch** as a fallback for any URL fetch. For auth-required APIs, use the pre-fetch/post-process pattern (see CLAUDE.md).

## Constraints

- Do not change the skill's tags or var semantics.
